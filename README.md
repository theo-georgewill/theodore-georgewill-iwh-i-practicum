## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate a Node.js/Express web app with the **HubSpot CRM API** using OAuth 2.0 authentication. It includes:

- HubSpot OAuth2 flow
- Custom object creation and updating
- Express routes and Pug templates
- API calls using Axios
- A simple frontend rendered via Pug

This implementation fulfills the practicum requirements and serves as a live example of HubSpot API integration best practices.

## Features Implemented

- OAuth2 authorization flow with HubSpot
- 2+ Express routes: homepage, create, update
